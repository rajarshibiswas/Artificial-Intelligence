The Pac-Man projects were originally developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics

[Python Basic](./python-basic)
This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.
Project Description: (http://ai.berkeley.edu/tutorial.html)

[Search](./search)
Implementation of Depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A\* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
Project Description (http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)

[Multi-Agent Search](./multiagent)
Implementation of  multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
Project Description (http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)

[Reinforcement Learning](./reinforcement)
Implementation of  model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
Project Description (http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)

[Tracking](./tracking)
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implementation of exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
